# Testing
* Include Step-by-step process to test the app
* Throughout the project testing was condcted on each page individually and the system as a whole.
* When each user story was completed all error checking on inputted data was tested to ensure no incorrect data was passed to the database.
* The connections between pages was also checked.
* Black box testing was also conducted through individuals with no prior knowledge of the system or the project to understand how users would interact with the system and find any potential errors (as shown below)


# Client Feedback
Progress updates were provided twice throughout the project where stakeholders were shown the progress made on the project and encouraged to provide feedback. This occured in the user story planning/ prototyping stage and mid way through iteration 2 and confirmed we were on track and inline with the goals of the project and assisted in determining which user stories would need to be completed in the first 2 iterations.
