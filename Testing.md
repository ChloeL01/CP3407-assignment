# Client Feedback
Progress updates were provided twice throughout the project where stakeholders were shown the progress made on the project and encouraged to provide feedback. This occured in the user story planning/ prototyping stage and mid way through iteration 2 and confirmed we were on track and inline with the goals of the project.
