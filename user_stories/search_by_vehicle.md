* this was later replaced with [Search by item](search_for_thing.md) as it was more broad
## Priority: 10 

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Bob: 1 day (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
* Lisa: 2 days
* Jack: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

1. Task 1, Estimation XX days
